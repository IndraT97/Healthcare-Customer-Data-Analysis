# Healthcare-Customer-Data-Analysis

## Experiment Overview
Helpbetter conducted an experiment to assess the impact of sending a reminder email to users 24 hours before the end of their 7-day trial. The goal was to determine whether the reminder email increased the likelihood of users converting to paying customers after the trial.

### Experiment Design
- **Variants**:
  - **YES**: Users received a reminder email.
  - **NO**: Users did not receive a reminder email.
- **Objective**: Analyze the experiment results to:
  1. Evaluate the overall impact on key metrics.
  2. Provide recommendations on whether to continue using the reminder email.
  3. Identify user cohorts with varying responses to the experiment.

## Key Findings
### Metrics Analysis
1. **Conversion Rates**:
   - **NO Group**: 83.44% conversion rate (higher).
   - **YES Group**: 78.82% conversion rate (lower).
   - **Observation**: The reminder email slightly decreased conversion rates.

2. **Refund Rates**:
   - **NO Group**: 2,265 refunds (significantly higher).
   - **YES Group**: 755 refunds (lower).
   - **Observation**: The reminder email reduced post-trial refunds.

3. **Pullbacks** (Cancellations during trial):
   - **YES Group**: 3,651 pullbacks (higher).
   - **NO Group**: 2,815 pullbacks (lower).
   - **Observation**: Reminder emails prompted more users to cancel earlier.

### Cohort Analysis
1. **Financial Status**:
   - Reminder emails reduced conversion rates across all financial status segments (Good, Fair, Poor).
   - Users in the **Fair** category showed the most significant increase in early cancellations.

2. **Source Group**:
   - **Podcast Users**: Showed improved conversion rates with reminder emails.
   - Other sources (e.g., SEO, Facebook): The NO group had higher conversion rates.

### Overall Observations
- The reminder email unintentionally led to:
  - Early cancellations during the trial period.
  - Reduced conversion rates for most user groups.
  - A positive impact on reducing refunds post-trial.

## Recommendations
1. **Short-Term**: Discontinue sending reminder emails in their current format.
2. **Improvements**:
   - Revise the email content to emphasize:
     - Benefits of continuing the service.
     - Success stories or testimonials.
     - Limited-time discounts for early conversion.
3. **Testing**:
   - Conduct A/B testing with updated email content to evaluate effectiveness.
   - Focus on specific cohorts (e.g., Podcast users) where the email had a positive impact.

## Conclusion
The reminder email, as currently implemented, does not achieve its intended purpose of increasing conversions. Instead, it leads to earlier cancellations and a slight decline in overall conversion rates. A revised strategy is necessary to better leverage reminder emails to drive positive outcomes.
